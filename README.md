# J-Car

So, welcome to my *J-Car* project ^_^

## About this project

So far, this has not been a mature project. I'm still learning almost everything about *Arduino* and *C++*. This project is actually a record of my learning process of these two techniques. It's worth to mention that, I have totally no idea about what this project is going to be in the future. **Therefore, if you have some awesome ideas or some advice on any part of this project, please don't hesitate to let me know.**

You can reach me by sending me an email via [0jason0wang0@gmail.com](0jason0wang0@gmail.com) for any problems on this project. Please be sure to add **[J-Car]** in front of the email title. Thank you.

## Functionalities now achieved

### Motion

The 4 wheels can be controlled seperately. 

### Bluetooth Control

Right now, I'm using `String` via HC-08 Bluetooth module to control the speed of the car.

## Upcoming functionalities

The followings are under developing, and the publishing time hasn't been decided yet.
